# Game Store

## Project Info

This is a simple project for a game store. It is called a simple project because it only contains 2 tables in the database, namely the Genre table and the Games table with a one-to-many relationship.

Basically, this project just displays a list of the games that are sold. Then, we can add new game data, then we can change the game data, and even delete the game data.

This project is divided into 2 folders:

1. Frontend
    * Blazor
    * Bootstrap
    * .NET8
2. Backend (RESTful API)
    * .NET8
    * SQLite
