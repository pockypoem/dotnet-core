* [Blazor State](https://timewarpengineering.github.io/blazor-state/)


## The differences between Blazor and React
* React is javascript based, Blazor is C# and .NET based
* React uses JSX, Blazor uses Razor Components
* React leverages Virtual DOM
* React Apps download smaller bundle sizes so faster load times than Blazor WebAssembly Apps
    * Blazor Server has much faster load times than Blazor WebAssembly but higher latency with Signal-R connection
* React has broader browser compatibility than Blazor WebAssembly
* Blazor WebAssembly -> fast processing of computationally intensive tasks
* React has vast community support but Blazor community is steadily growing
* Blazor has support and heavy investments from Microsoft

## When to use Blazor?
* Already have C# and .NET skills
* Your app involves executing computationally intensive tasks
* Your app requires a lot of real-time updates
* Your app requires a full-stack solution

## When to use React?
* Large scale front-end applications
* For faster initial load times
* Already have Javascript and React skills
* For broader browser support
